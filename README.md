->Airlines Delay: Airline on-time statistics and delay causes

 Important

Reduce the size of the dataset randomly to obtain a dataset of only 200,000 records. All exercises must be done with this reduced dataset.



- Exercise 2
  
Make a complete report of the dataset:

Summarize statistically the dataset and the columns of interest. Make a statistical analysis of what you consider relevant.
Finds how much missing data there is per column.
Create new columns (average speed of the flight, if it has arrived late or not...).
Make a table of the airlines with more accumulated delays.
Which are the longest flights? And the longest? Look for the longest routes and those with the longest delays.
Contribute what you consider relevant.


- Exercise 3
  
Export the dataset net and with the new columns to Excel.
